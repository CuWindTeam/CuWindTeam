I chose to join the cu wind team because I wanted to have a chance to work on a difficult problem with a good goal. Renewables have always been of interest to me and so has fluid dynamics which makes few projects a better fit for me. It allows me to learn what I would like to learn and work on a problem I truly care about. Another reason why I chose this project is to work within a larger team. Having only worked in smaller teams prior to this class I wanted to have the experience of working on large projects from start to finish and having to communicate with what could be a whole engineering group in a company. This project continues to give me a wide range of experiences while also being fun.

# Responsibilities
As systems engineer I worked on making sure the integration of the subsystems would work as planned. My other responsibilities included coding a python script to take the complex geometries of the blade from equation to an STL file so we could print the blades.
